## 🎆 Highlights
&emsp; &emsp; AnaGPT is a chatGPT class natural language processing program based on the terminal command interface and referring to Anaconda working mode. It can easily load multiple professional prompts at once and automatically synthesize all prompts or choose one to answer based on user questions.

- 🤲 **More Stable** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; API interface to prevent webpage F5/refresh 
- 🚗 **More Convenient** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Command line to view and install professional prompt
- 🎨 **More diverse** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Multiple custom combinations of prompts and support for simple statement calls

<h2 id="Example"> 
🌰 Example
</h2>

&emsp; &emsp; When you install multiple ```pkg (prompt)``` for a ```env (prompts)```, Simply enter some simple words when asking questions, and AnaGPT will automatically select the most suitable installed ```pkg (prompt)``` to answer. Below is a comparison of AnaGPT and ChatGPT's answers to the same question. AnaGPT can automatically find the installed professional ```pkg (prompt)``` to answer by adding some simple prompts after the question. Of course, you can also avoid adding any prompts at the end of the question, as it will automatically select the ```pkg (prompt)``` based on your question.

## 👋🏼 Intro

&emsp;&emsp;  The purpose of natural language processing (NLP) is to enable machines to understand human language. GPT-like large language models have achieved this goal to a significant extent by predicting language expressions of all human knowledge.😄 
However, due to the vastness of human knowledge, such models are unable to autonomously, effectively, and deeply answer specific domain questions in practical use. ☹️

&emsp;&emsp; To address this issue, Prompt technology has emerged. Through prompts, we can further guide GPT to avoid the interference of irrelevant domain knowledge and provide deep answers that meet our requirements. Therefore, the value of the same GPT in answering content under different prompts can vary greatly. To obtain more valuable answers, each prompt should be carefully crafted. 🤔

&emsp; &emsp;There are currently many open-source professional prompts related to various fields and tasks. We hope to make it more convenient to call them. 🍜 
Also, we hope to combine different prompts to generate more diverse professional prompts. This process is similar to installing different functions and attributes on GPT. By customizing the combination, we can make GPT meet our requirements for a particular task. 🤖 

&emsp; &emsp;To achieve the above goals, we have referred to the working mode of Anaconda. Users can create a new environment with a simple command and directly install multiple official professional prompts. Then, they can activate the environment to set the prompt. The mapping relationship is as follows: 🤓

|  AnaGPT | Anaconda  |
| :------------: | :------------: |
|  GPT |python   |
| prompt  | package  |
| prompts  | environment  |


&emsp; &emsp; Therefore, the interaction between AnaGPT and the user is based on the terminal command-line interface. Of course, a pure command-line interface is neater and cooler. It is worth noting that you can paste multiple lines of information and ask questions at the same time in the AnaGPT terminal interface. This feature is extremely important for inquiring about code error information. 👍

&emsp; &emsp; What is more, we have implemented some of the main functions of the web-based chatGPT, including archiving and loading of historical information. At the same time, we have also considered chat based on given files and chat that can search the Internet. The former has been implemented, and the latter is still under development. 🎁

&emsp; &emsp; In addition to the above reasons, another reason for doing this project is that the chatGPT official website is becoming less user-friendly, and there are currently severe blockades in the Asian region, making it difficult to use the website. Every time a question is asked, the webpage needs to be refreshed, and the magic is not very effective. 😔
Moreover, some other chat programs based on the chatGPT API are difficult to achieve our goal of conveniently loading multiple professional prompts. 🤔
On the other hand, while a graphical user interface may be more user-friendly for beginners, general researchers may not require it very much. They may feel that the interface is not clean enough and not extensible enough (the interface buttons need to increase with the increase of prompts). 😕

7. run```main.py```
```
python main.py

# Results:

(anagpt) PS E:\ProjectEX\AnaGPT> python main.py

 AnaGPT v1.0, Model: gpt-3.5-turbo

 Try "gpt help".

 (base) >
```

8. Alternatively, after creating a new environment and installing the dependency package, a new startup file can be created for future use:

```
#For Windows systems
#Create a new '.cmd' file, enter the following content to save and close the file:

@echo off
call activate anagpt
python main.py
pause

```

9. If you want to create a new desktop shortcut, remember to add the AnaGPT project path in the "Start Position (S)" section of the shortcut's properties to ensure that the program runs normally. Or you can input the following command in AnaGPT:
```
gpt create shortcut
```

<h2 id="Usage"> 
🕹️  Usage
</h2>

You can use the following command to operate AnaGPT:
```
This is a Python function that defines a set of commands and keyboards that users can enter or push in a GPT chatbot environment.

The `commands` dictionary contains the commands that the user can enter and their corresponding functions. The available commands are:

- `gpt -version`: show the version of the GPT chatbot.
- `gpt env list`: display a list of available environments.
- `gpt env list -des`: display a detailed list of available environments.
- `gpt create -n *`: create a new environment with the given name. The `*` should be replaced with the desired name of the environment. An optional `-clone` flag can be used to clone an existing environment.
- `gpt activate *`: activate the environment with the given name. The `*` should be replaced with the name of the environment to activate.
- `gpt deactivate`: deactivate the current environment.
- `gpt remove -n *`: remove the environment with the given name. The `*` should be replaced with the name of the environment to remove.
- `gpt help`: display a general help message.
- `gpt help -n *`: display a help message for the command with the given name. The `*` should be replaced with the name of the command to get help for.
- `gpt install -n *`: install a new package with the given name. The `*` should be replaced with the name of the package to install. An optional `-c` flag can be used to specify the package content directly on the command line.
- `gpt uninstall -n *`: uninstall the package with the given name. The `*` should be replaced with the name of the package to uninstall.
- `gpt pkgs update`: update the list of locally available packages.
- `gpt pkgs list`: display a list of locally available packages.
- `gpt list`: display a list of packages in the current environment.
- `gpt vim`: open the Vim editor to edit the content of a package in the current environment.
- `gpt clear`: clear the screen and chat history.
- `gpt history list`: display a list of available chat history files.
- `gpt history recover`: recover a previous chat history file.
- `gpt history remove -n *`: remove the chat history file with the given name. The `*` should be replaced with the name of the chat history file to remove.
- `gpt history remove -all`: remove all chat history files.
- `gpt chat *`: start a chat based on a set of files. The `*` should be replaced with the path to the files that should be used for chat-based conversation.

The `keyboards` dictionary contains functions that are called when certain keys are pressed. At the moment, there is only one function that is called when `ctrl+shift` is pressed. This function cancels the current output flow.
```

The above content can be obtained by entering the following command after running AnaGPT:
```
gpt help
```
##  👀  Special Instructions
- AnaGPT supports command line multi line content pasting. When pasting multi line content, cmd may pop up a warning for multi line pasting:
  ```
  Warning that you will be pasting text with multiple lines. If you paste this text into a shell, it may cause
  ```
  To remove this warning, you can open the settings JSON file of the Windows cmd terminal and add the following command:
  ```
  "multiLinePasteWarning": false
  ```

  📄


- Each 'env' in AnaGPT may correspond to multiple system prompts. Before each response, it first determines which system prompt to base the response on. When it is unclear which system prompt to base the response on, it will ask you for guidance again. 🤔
